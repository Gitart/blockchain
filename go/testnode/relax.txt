// I enjoyed doing two things.
// First, watch the river how flow
// The second is to hear a noisy garden or forest.
// This leads me to relaxation and pleasure.
// I do not like very noisy streets and loud people.
// I want to get up every morning and look at the glass lake.
// I want to see far away mountains with snow head.
